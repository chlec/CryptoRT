## CryptoRT

A simple web panel to see your stocks of cryptocurrencies in realtime using APIs. Bittrex and Poloniex supported.

Built with Node.js using ExpressJS.

You can see your stocks, evolution in USD, in BTC, percent of change, and you can sell your coin instantly with the latest price.

I did this project for myself only but I decided to post the source code on github. The code may be innaproriate for you.
